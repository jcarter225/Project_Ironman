# Project_Ironman

This was a project completed during the DS 705 Statistical Methods course for the Data Science Master's program at the University of Wisconsin - Superior. The general purpose of the project was to analyze a dataset to determine whether or not there was a significant difference in Ironman completion times between different groups of participants. In addition, another goal for the project was to determine the most important components of the race in determining final race times. Simple Linear Regression with normalization was employed in order to conduct this analysis. IM_Florida_20.csv and IM_Florida_21.csv are the datasets utilized in the analysis. The Project3FinalPaper.docx file contains the final report for the project, the Project3FinalPaper.Rmd file contains the code utilized in the analysis, and the Project_Instructions.txt file contains the general instructions for completion of the project.
